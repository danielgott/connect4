This Connect 4 game is written in python. I used PyCharm and Sublime Text 3 to write most of this code.
The two librarys I used to write this code is the Numpy and Random


In order to play the game in Sublime Text 3, you will need to install SublimeREPL command in order to initialize the int variable

In order to paly the game in PyCharm you only need to select the Numpy interpreter and the game should function correctly
